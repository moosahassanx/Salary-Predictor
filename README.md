# Description
 This machine learning model aimes to predict a person's salary based on their country, years of experience and level of education. The data was taken from Stack Overflow's Annual Developer Survey of 2021 (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). The CSV data was taken and transformed using Pandas, a Data Analysis Library, to create a usable dataset which can be trained and tested. The model was saved using Pickle and used into the web application *(more at add later)*.

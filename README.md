# Description
 This machine learning model aimes to predict a person's salary based on their country, years of experience and level of education. The data was taken from [Stack Overflow's Annual Developer Survey of 2021](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). The CSV data was taken and transformed using Pandas, a Data Analysis Library, to create a usable dataset which can be trained and tested. The model was saved using Pickle and used iinto the Streamlit front-end machine learning framework to be displayed.

# Instructions
 ## Machine Learning Model
  1. Install Jupyter Notebook [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
  2. Clone this repository to your computer.
  3. Open command prompt (or terminal for you Linux nerds) and navigate to the project directory.
  4. Run the command <code>$ jupyter notebook</code>.
  5. Open ML Programming.ipynb.
  6. Click on "Kernel" > "Restart and & Run All".

 ## Streamlit
  The website is already deployed [here](https://github.com/moosahassanx/Salary-Predictor). To locally run:
   1. Open command prompt (or terminal for you Linux nerds again) and navigate to the project directory.
   2. Run the command <code>streamlit run app.py</code>.
   3. Your browser should automatically open a window/tab displaying the page.

# Credits
This code was inspired by Python Engineer on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/PythonEngineer) in which he uses dataset from 2020. My model is updated for the 2021 dataset. Other prediction models of the same dataset will be added to this project.
